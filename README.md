# PreWeave

An optional service in-front of Arweave that allows users of the network to create and use decentralized IDs for their content, 
without commiting the data to the network for storage at generation time. 
At the PreWeave node operatorâ€™s discretion, data from this service can be replicated on other PreWeave nodes, 
and/or dispatched to the Arweave network for permanent storage.
